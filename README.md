# Elevate-Labs-Internship

This repository contains all tasks, assignments, and project components completed as part of my internship at Elevate Labs.
Throughout the internship, I will continuously update this repository with the work I complete, reflecting my progress, learning, and contributions.

As the final project , I created web application vulnerability scanner .

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a well-organized record of all internship-related activities and to document my journey at Elevate Labs in a structured and professional manner.
